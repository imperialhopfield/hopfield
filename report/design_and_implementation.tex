\section{First experiments}

\subsection{Basin Size in One Cluster using T1}

Our first experiment is showing us the basin sizes for increasing values of p, the probability of flipping a bit. Method T1 is used, for a Hopfield Network of N neurons.

\begin{easylist}[enumerate]                                                                            
\ListProperties(Style2*=,Numbers=a,Numbers1=R,FinalMark=.)
& We generate a random pattern \(\mu\)

& For all values of probability p from 0 to 0.5

    && Starting from \(\mu\) we generate P patterns using T1, and give them to the Hopfield network in order to be learned according to Hebb or Storkey rule.
 
    && We measure the basin size for all the patterns learned using the Storkey-Valabregue measurement and take their mean. 
\end{easylist}
