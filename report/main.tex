\begin{document}
% General notes:

% "This is more marketing than engineering. We don't want a diary"

% Tony: "How long? I don't know. Keep it short. 30 pages is absolutely fine.
% 40 a bit too much. 20 is a bit..."

% Keep it simple and to the point. Don't waffle

% Report is read by people who DONT know your work, though they are
% technically minded


\section{Executive Summary}
% Compulsory
% 1 page max. Tony: "third to half a page ideal probably"
% Anandha: "Don't put a photo of your group in the executive summary!!!"



\section{Introduction}
% Tony: "1, 2, 3 pages"
% What is the problem?
% Why is it interesting?
% How did you solve it?
% How far did you get?

% Includes motivation, objectives, and contributions (what you achieved)


\section{Design and Implementation}
% Justify design decisions, tools used, etc.
% NO CODE!!! (except for skeleton of algorithms maybe)



\section{Evaluation}
% Step back and say things like:
% "X worked out well"
% "in hindsight we could have used this tool instead"

% How do we know that our code works?
% e.g. functionality + performance testing
% show relevant testing *results*

% In a nutshell, how successful was this project
% Tony: "DONT SAY: all our objectives (from intro) were met. Have the maturity
% to show your mistakes and more importantly what you learned!"


\section{Conclusion and Future Extensions}
% Tony: "Conclusion is NOT a summary"
% e.g. result that you did not know about

\section{Project Management}
% Use this to convey your *group collaboration*
% Team organisation, supervisor, software engineering team skills

% DONT give lots of text about the SE process (a la diary), rather your team,
% deliverables, etc
