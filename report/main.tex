% General notes:

% Report Guidlines:
% http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/thirdyear/group-project/ReportGuidelines2012.pdf

% "This is more marketing than engineering. We don't want a diary"

% Tony: "How long? I don't know. Keep it short. 30 pages is absolutely fine.
% 40 a bit too much. 20 is a bit..."
% NOTE this excludes the appendices

% Keep it simple and to the point. Don't waffle

% Report is read by people who DONT know your work, though they are
% technically minded

\tableofcontents

\include{introduction}

\include{background_research}

\chapter{Design and Implementation}
% Justify design decisions, tools used, etc.
% NO CODE!!! (except for skeleton of algorithms maybe)



\chapter{Evaluation}
% Step back and say things like:
% "X worked out well"
% "in hindsight we could have used this tool instead"

% How do we know that our code works?
% e.g. functionality + performance testing
% show relevant testing *results*

% In a nutshell, how successful was this project
% Tony: "DONT SAY: all our objectives (from intro) were met. Have the maturity
% to show your mistakes and more importantly what you learned!"


\chapter{Conclusion and Future Extensions}
% Tony: "Conclusion is NOT a summary"
% e.g. result that you did not know about

\chapter{Project Management}
% Use this to convey your *group collaboration*
% Team organisation, supervisor, software engineering team skills

% DONT give lots of text about the SE process (a la diary), rather your team,
% deliverables, etc

% Note that group collaboration is worth 30%. This is part assessed by our
% supervisor comments, how we present ourselves, and probably a bit will be
% influenced by what we say here. Bare this in mind!

\chapter{Appendices}
% these do NOT count as part of the suggested page count
% This is probably a good place to explain the models in some detail for example
