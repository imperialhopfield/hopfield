Attractor Neural networks have been a subject of intensive research in the past 30 years. They have been proposed as a model of associative memory and have been used in applications such as facial and speech recognition or for modelling biological activities or the human brain.


The task of our project was to get a deeper understanding of these networks by simulating them and investigating their properties. For this purpose, we have showed their importance by implementing an image recognition software. Furthermore, we have also used them for modelling a psychological concept called Attachment Theory, in order to better understand the human mind and how to cure various mental disorders.

Our project is trying to model, on a metaphorical level, how an individual will react given various positive or negative memories. We have implemented two mathematical models of neural networks, that can simulate various functions of the brain. Amongst these, two of them are of uttermost importance: learning and recalling information. We analysed how easy different memories are recalled, how probable it is for one memory to be recalled, or how some memories can be forgotten or reinforced. The latter is extremely important for the psychological studies, since it provides a way of curing some mental disorders that have been caused by negative memories.

% should we include some of the results as well?
