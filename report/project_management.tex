% Use this to convey your *group collaboration*
% Team organisation, supervisor, software engineering team skills

% DONT give lots of text about the SE process (a la diary), rather your team,
% deliverables, etc

% Note that group collaboration is worth 30%. This is part assessed by our
% supervisor comments, how we present ourselves, and probably a bit will be
% influenced by what we say here. Bare this in mind!

We started out the project by thoroughly investigating the Hopfield model, reading important research papers that were describing it in detail and showing the potential for other applications. 

Once we had a firm understanding of the mathematical model, we assigned various tasks to each members in order to create a simple image recognition application. Wael and Mihaela started implementing the core algorithm in Haskell, based on information gathered from the research papers. Razvan implemented the image preprocessing in C, while Niklas was integrating the Haskell algorithmmic core with the C programs. 

We heavily followed the advice that Prof Chatley offered in the Software Engineering Lectures. Therefore, we used to have regular weekly meetings and perform iterative development in order to make sure we have a working version of our product at any time.
