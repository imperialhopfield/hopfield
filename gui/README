in order to make python to haskell work one has to do the following:

1. cabal install dph-par
2. cabal install dph-seq
3. sudo apt-get install ghc-dynamic

run ghc-v and see your version of ghc.
Open make file and complete GHC variable with your version of ghc
eg:
GHC=ghc-7.4.1

Change the second variable to match the version of ghc passed in the first one.

Run make
